<h4>Billie Holiday at age 2</h4>
    <h3>Beginnings</h3>
    <p>The performer we know as Billie Holidy was born Eleanora Fagan in April 1915. Holiday had a difficult childhood. Her mother often took what were then known as transportation jobs, serving on passenger railroads. Holiday was left to be raised largely by Eva Miller's mother-in-law, Martha Miller, and suffered from her mother's absences and being left in the care of others for much of the first ten years of her life. Holiday's autobiography, Lady Sings the Blues, first published in 1956, is sketchy on details of her early life, but much was confirmed by Stuart Nicholson in his 1995 biography of the singer. </p>
    <br>
    <h3>To Harlem</h3>
    <p>By the end of 1928, Holiday's mother left Baltimore and moved to Harlem, New York, and left Holiday again with Martha Miller. By early 1929, Holiday had joined her mother in Harlem. As a young teenager, Holiday started singing in nightclubs in Harlem. She took her professional pseudonym from Billie Dove, an actress she admired, and the musician Clarence Holiday, her probable father. At the outset of her career, she spelled her last name "Halliday", the birth surname of her father, but eventually changed it to "Holiday", his performing name. </p>
    <br>
    <h3>First Recordings</h3>
    <p>In 1935 Holiday was signed to Brunswick Records by John Hammond to record current pop tunes with Teddy Wilson in the new swing style for the growing jukebox trade. They were given free rein to improvise the material. Holiday's improvisation of melody to fit the emotion was revolutionary. Their first collaboration included "What a Little Moonlight Can Do", and "Miss Brown to You". Another frequent accompanist was the tenor saxophonist Lester Young, who had been a boarder at her mother's house in 1934 and with whom Holiday had a special rapport. </p>

    <h3>"Strange Fruit"</h3>
    <p>Holiday was recording for Columbia in the late 1930s when she was introduced to "Strange Fruit", a song based on a poem about lynching written by Abel Meeropol, a Jewish schoolteacher from the Bronx."God Bless the Child" became Holiday's most popular and most covered record. It reached number 25 on the charts in 1941 and was third in Billboard's songs of the year, selling over a million records.Holiday did not make any more records until August 1945, when she recorded "Don't Explain" for a second time.In September 1946, Holiday began her only major film, New Orleans, in which she starred opposite Louis Armstrong and Woody Herman. </p>

    <h3>Addiction and Prison</h3>
    <p>Holiday's drug addictions were a problem on the set. She earned more than a thousand dollars a week from club ventures but spent most of it on heroin.By 1947, Holiday was at her commercial peak, having made $250,000 in the three previous years.On May 16, 1947, Holiday was arrested for possession of narcotics in her New York apartment.She was sentenced to Alderson Federal Prison Camp in West Virginia. Holiday was released early (on March 16, 1948), because of good behavior.On March 27, 1948, Holiday played Carnegie Hall to a sold-out crowd.Between 1944 and 1957 Holiday performed at Carnegie Hall 22 times. Holiday was arrested again on January 22, 1949, in her room at the Hotel Mark Twain in San Francisco.</p>

    <h4>Memoir written with William Dufty</h4>
    <h3>Lady Sings the Blues</h3>
    <p>By the 1950s, Holiday's drug abuse, drinking, and relationships with abusive men caused her health to deteriorate. Holiday's autobiography, Lady Sings the Blues, was ghostwritten by William Dufty and published in 1956.To accompany her autobiography, Holiday released the LP Lady Sings the Blues in June 1956. On March 28, 1957, Holiday married Louis McKay, a Mafia enforcer. McKay, like most of the men in her life, was abusive, but he did try to get her to stop using drugs.</p>

    <h3>Death</h3>
    <p>By early 1959 Holiday had cirrhosis of the liver.On May 31, 1959, Holiday was taken to Metropolitan Hospital in New York for treatment of liver disease and heart disease. The Federal Bureau of Narcotics, under the order of Harry J. Anslinger, had been targeting Holiday since at least 1939. She was arrested and handcuffed for drug possession as she lay dying, her hospital room was raided, and she was placed under police guard  On July 15, she received the last rites of the Roman Catholic Church and died two days later, on July 17, 1959, at 3:10 a.m., of pulmonary edema and heart failure caused by cirrhosis of the liver. In her final years, she had been progressively swindled out of her earnings, and she died with $0.70 in the bank and $750 (a tabloid fee) on her person.</p>
